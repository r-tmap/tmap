# Thematic Map Visualization

Thematic maps are geographical maps in which spatial data distributions
are visualized. This package offers a flexible, layer-based, and easy to
use approach to create thematic maps, such as choropleths and bubble
maps. It is based on the grammar of graphics, and resembles the syntax
of ggplot2.
