- added geocode_OSM, a function to find coordinates
- improved set_projection for raster objects
- added double_line and offset_line
- added insets option in save_tmap
- improved default settings for contrast arugment regarding seq and div palettes

- improved tm_layouts's design.mode output
- lwd parameter added to tm_scale_bar and tm_compass
- fixed bb bug

version 1.2-1
- fixed bug with PROJ.4 version < 4.9.1

- added read_osm, a function to read Open Street Map data
- added bb, a handy bounding box function
- added layout themes with tm_style and tm_format
- added automatic text labeling
- added interactive SVG, that can be opend in RStudio (see itmap)
- added map compass (tm_compass)
- added text aesthetics size and col
- added automatic map coloring
- added earth boundary, which is useful for projected world maps
- added warped grid lines (e.g. long-lat lines can be shown in projected maps)
- added new color scale modes (enabled with style="cat", "cont", and "order")
- added save_tmap
- added smooth_map, smooth_raster_cover, sample_dots, points_to_raster and poly_to_raster
- added read_GPX
- improved automatic layout regarding title, legend, and map attributes
- layer arguments, e.g. palette, can take multiple values for small multiples
- improved grid lines (labels can also be placed outside frame)
- arguments free.coords and drop.shapes of tm_facets working
- updated examples and vignette
- fixed viewport bug
- see ?tmap for a structured overview of all tmap functions

version 1.0
- added tm_credits and tm_scale_bar
- added is.master argument to tm_shape, that determines which shape is the master
- added unit and unit.size arguments to tm_shape that correlates the coordinates with the desired units
- added tm_polygons, which is a combination of tm_fill and tm_borders
- fixed several small bugs

version 0.8
- added tm_raster
- improved legend behaviour: legend titles should be set in the layer functions (instead of in tm_layout)
- removed crop_shape, since raster::crop does the same job, but, but faster
- out-of-scope functions migrated to spatialToolbox package, available on github.com/mtennekes/spatialToolbox

version 0.7.1

- improved number formatting in legend
- improved inner.margins and outer.margins. Both can take one value (e.g. outer.margins=0 rather than outer.margins=c(0,0,0,0))
- improved qtm: tm_facets parameters working, and also fixed scale parameter bug
- improved all examples for approx_areas, calc_densities
- fixed bug regarding drawing a frame with outer.margins=0. 
- fixed bug in plotting blubbles
- improved temp file handling in animation_tmap
- added functions to get and set polygon directions, and to calculate the intersection ratios of polygons (intersection_shapes)
