version 1.4
- [!] interactive mapping added. Now, tmap has two modes: "plot" (graphics device) and "view" (interactive viewer, which is a leaflet widget)
- [!] facets (small multiples) improved: group by two variables possible, panel layout added, missing data can be shown separately
- added geocode_OSM, a function to find coordinates
- improved set_projection for raster objects
- added double_line and offset_line
- added insets option in save_tmap
- improved default settings for contrast arugment regarding seq and div palettes
- improved automatic positions of legend and map attributes (more specifically, legend snaps to righthand-side without need to adjust legend.width, and legend and attributes position improved when double frame is enabled)
- improved tm_layouts's design.mode output
- lwd parameter added to tm_scale_bar and tm_compass
- fixed bb bug

version 1.2-1
- fixed bug with PROJ.4 version < 4.9.1
- improved error messages
- rd projection reset to +init=epsg:28992, since the latter now has a +towgs item
- fixed bug of print.tmap returned object

version 1.2
- added read_osm, a function to read Open Street Map data
- added bb, a handy bounding box function
- added layout themes with tm_style and tm_format
- added automatic text labeling
- added interactive SVG, that can be opend in RStudio (see itmap)
- added map compass (tm_compass)
- added text aesthetics size and col
- added automatic map coloring
- added earth boundary, which is useful for projected world maps
- added warped grid lines (e.g. long-lat lines can be shown in projected maps)
- added new color scale modes (enabled with style="cat", "cont", and "order")
- added save_tmap
- added smooth_map, smooth_raster_cover, sample_dots, points_to_raster and poly_to_raster
- added read_GPX
- improved automatic layout regarding title, legend, and map attributes
- layer arguments, e.g. palette, can take multiple values for small multiples
- improved grid lines (labels can also be placed outside frame)
- arguments free.coords and drop.shapes of tm_facets working
- updated examples and vignette
- fixed viewport bug
- see ?tmap for a structured overview of all tmap functions

version 1.0
- added tm_credits and tm_scale_bar
- added is.master argument to tm_shape, that determines which shape is the master
- added unit and unit.size arguments to tm_shape that correlates the coordinates with the desired units
- added tm_polygons, which is a combination of tm_fill and tm_borders
- fixed several small bugs

version 0.8
- added tm_raster
- improved legend behaviour: legend titles should be set in the layer functions (instead of in tm_layout)
- removed crop_shape, since raster::crop does the same job, but, but faster
- out-of-scope functions migrated to spatialToolbox package, available on github.com/mtennekes/spatialToolbox

version 0.7.1
- fixed big in scale parameter (global scale set in tm_layout)

version 0.7
- enhanced small multiples (tm_facets) with respect to scaling and free coordinate scales 
- added alpha argument to tm layers for transparency
- added text shadow argument
- added function split to split a shape object and sbind to combine shape objects.
- added automatic legend positioning when legend.position=NULL
- improved number formatting in legend
- improved inner.margins and outer.margins. Both can take one value (e.g. outer.margins=0 rather than outer.margins=c(0,0,0,0))
- improved qtm: tm_facets parameters working, and also fixed scale parameter bug
- improved all examples for approx_areas, calc_densities
- fixed bug regarding drawing a frame with outer.margins=0. 
- fixed bug in plotting blubbles
- improved temp file handling in animation_tmap
- added functions to get and set polygon directions, and to calculate the intersection ratios of polygons (intersection_shapes)

version 0.6
- this is the the first CRAN version
- a newer version may be available on https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap
