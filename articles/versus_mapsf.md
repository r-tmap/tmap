# tmap versus: mapsf

## mapsf

The R package [mapsf](https://riatelab.github.io/mapsf/) is an excellent
package for static thematic maps. It is similar to tmaps “plot” mode.

### Map layers

`mapsf` also offers different map layers, but in contrast to `tmap`
where these are generated by different functions
(e.g. [`tm_polygons()`](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/reference/tm_polygons.md)
and
[`tm_symbols()`](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/reference/tm_symbols.md)),
`mapsf` uses one function `mf_map`, where the map layer type is
specified via the argument `type`.

### Components

Map components, such as a title, compass, scale bar, and credits text,
can be added with both packages. In `mapsf` these are `mf_title`,
`mf_arrow`, `mf_scale`, and `mf_credits` respectively.

### Different legends

The legends of `mapsf` and `tmap` are different:

- In `tmap` proportional symbols are always drawn next to each other
  whereas in `mapsf` they are drawn on top of each other. Also the the
  color legend for class intervals is different. Both are shown below.

### Shadow layer

`mapsf` has an awesome layer type that `tmap` does not have (yet):
`mf_shadow`, which draws a shadow under polygons. See last example below

### Inset (‘mini’) map

In `mapsf` a inset map can be added via `mf_inset_on`. In tmap, inset
maps can be added via the argument `vp` in the `print` function.

A special and very handy use case is `mf_inset_on(x = "worldmap")` where
a globe is plotted with a red arrow that should the location of the main
map. In `tmap` this feature is still only available via “view” mode with
the function `tm_minimap`.

### Styling and themes

Both packages offer styling options and themes. In both packages own
styles can be created. However, `tmap` has much more styling options
available. See
[`mf_theme()`](https://riatelab.github.io/mapsf/reference/mf_theme.html)
and
[`tm_layout()`](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/reference/tm_layout.md).

### Base vs grid graphics

A key difference between the “plot” mode of `tmap` and `mapsf` is that
the “plot” mode of `tmap` makes use of the `grid` package (just like
`ggplot2`) whereas `mapsf` uses base R graphics. This has some
implications when combining plots.

### Dependencies

`mapsf` has much less dependencies than `tmap`, so installation is
faster.

## Bubble map

An example of `mapsf` applied to the tmap dataset \[NLD_muni\].

``` r
library(mapsf)
mf_map(NLD_muni)
mf_map(NLD_muni, var = "population", type = "prop", leg_pos = "topright", add = TRUE)
mf_layout(
  title = "Population in Dutch municipalities in 2022",
  credits = "Statistics Netherlands (CBS)")
```

In `tmap` (using the same colors):

``` r
tm_shape(NLD_muni) +
  tm_polygons( "gray80") +
  tm_bubbles(fill = "tomato4", size = "population") +
tm_title("Population in Dutch municipalities in 2022") +
tm_credits("Statistics Netherlands (CBS)", position = c("left", "bottom"))
```

![](versus_mapsf_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

Increase the overall size of the bubbles:

``` r
tm_shape(NLD_muni) +
  tm_polygons( "gray80") +
tm_bubbles(
  fill = "tomato4", 
  size = "population",
  size.scale = tm_scale(values.scale = 5)) +
tm_title("Population in Dutch municipalities in 2022") +
tm_credits("Statistics Netherlands (CBS)", position = c("left", "bottom")) +
tm_compass() +
tm_scalebar()
```

## Choropleth

``` r
mf_map(NLD_muni, var = "edu_appl_sci", type = "choro", leg_pos = "topright")
mf_layout(
  title = "Population share with (applied) university degree in 2022",
  credits = "Statistics Netherlands (CBS)")
```

![](versus_mapsf_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

In tmap, using similar specifications:

``` r
tm_shape(NLD_muni) +
  tm_polygons(
    fill = "edu_appl_sci",
    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(values = "carto.mint", style = "quantile", n = 9),
    fill.legend = tm_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +
tm_title("Population share with (applied) university degree in 2022") +
tm_credits("Statistics Netherlands (CBS)", position = c("left", "bottom")) +
tm_scalebar()
#> [plot mode] fit legend/component: Some legend items or map compoments do not
#> fit well, and are therefore rescaled.
#> ℹ Set the tmap option `component.autoscale = FALSE` to disable rescaling.
```

## Shadow layer

``` r
mf_shadow(NLD_muni)
mf_map(NLD_muni, var = "edu_appl_sci", type = "choro", leg_pos = "topright", add = TRUE)
```

![](versus_mapsf_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

`tmap` does not has a similar layer function (yet), but it can be done
with geometric manipulation in `sf`:

``` r
library(sf)
#> Linking to GEOS 3.12.1, GDAL 3.8.4, PROJ 9.4.0; sf_use_s2() is TRUE
shadows = st_set_crs(st_geometry(NLD_muni) + c(2000, -2000), st_crs(NLD_muni))

tm_shape(shadows) +
  tm_fill("grey50") +
tm_shape(NLD_muni) +
  tm_polygons(
    fill = "edu_appl_sci",
    fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(values = "carto.mint", style = "quantile", n = 9),
    fill.legend = tm_legend(reverse = TRUE)) 
```
