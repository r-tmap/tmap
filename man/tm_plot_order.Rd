\title{Determine plotting order of features}
\usage{
tm_plot_order(
  aes,
  reverse = TRUE,
  na.order = c("mix", "bottom", "top"),
  null.order = c("bottom", "mix", "top"),
  null.below.na = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{aes}{visual variable for which the values determine the plotting order. Example: bubble map where the \code{"size"} aesthetic is used. A data variable (say population) is mapped via a continuous scale (\code{tm_scale_continuous}) to bubble sizes. The bubbles are plotted in order of size. How is determined by the other arguments. Use \code{"DATA"} to keep the same order as in the data. Another special value is \code{"AREA"} which is preserved for polygons: rather than a data variable the polygon area determines the plotting order.}

\item{reverse}{logical that determines whether the visual values are plotted in reversed order. The visual values (specified with tmap option \code{"values.var"}) are by default reversed, so plotted starting from the last value. In the bubble map example, this means that large bubbles are plotted first, hence at the bottom.}

\item{na.order}{where should features be plotted that have an \code{NA} value for (at least) one other aesthetic variable? In the (order) \code{"mix"}, at the \code{"bottom"}, or on \code{"top"}? In the bubble map example: if fill color is missing for some bubble, where should those bubbles be plotted?}

\item{null.order}{where should non-selected (aka null) features be plotted?}

\item{null.below.na}{should null features be plotted below NA features?}
