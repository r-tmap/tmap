- few fixes in legend computing and size (#1039, #1032)

# tmap 4.0

tmap v4 is a major release and has been rewritten from scratch. It contains tons of new features. Although we did our best to make changes backwards compatible, some things may not work as expected.

### New syntax

* The arguments of layer functions such as `tm_symbols()` have been reorganized. [Visual variables](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/articles/01_basics_vv.html) are used with explicit [scales](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/articles/basics_scales), [legends](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/articles/basics_legends), and [charts](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/articles/basics_charts).
* The names of visual variables are consistent across standard map layer functions. For vector data, `fill` is the visual variable for fill color and `col` for border color.
* New [vignettes](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/index.html) available to explain how to upgrade your code to tmap v4.

### Updated datasets

* `rivers` has been renamed to `World_rivers` due to the name clash with `rivers` from `datasets`. 
* The Netherlands datasets have been updated: from 2022  `NLD_prov`, `NLD_muni`, and (new) `NLD_dist` (district level) have been included with new demographic variables.
* `land` has included color tables

### Extensions

* tmap can now be [extended](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/articles/adv_extensions) in several ways.

### Backwards compatibility

* All tmap v3 code should be backwards compatible with v4.
* We added 'v3' styles to make the layout (almost) identical to v3
* We introduced messages to make it easier for you to upgrade your code
